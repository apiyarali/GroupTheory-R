# [Dihedral Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group) D4 App

Link to Published App: https://alipiyarali.shinyapps.io/GroupD4/

## Introduction

The Group D4 app demonstrates the Dihedral Group D4, which represents the symmetries of a square. This group consists of rotations and reflections that map the square onto itself. The app provides an interactive way to explore these symmetries and understand how they correspond to elements of the group.

## What is Dihedral Group D4?

Dihedral Group D4 represents the symmetries of a square. It includes 8 elements: 4 rotations and 4 reflections. The rotations are by multiples of 90 degrees, and the reflections are across the diagonals and the midpoints of the sides of the square.

In this app, you can apply these symmetries (rotations and flips) to see how the square changes. Each operation corresponds to an element of the D4 group.

## Features

1. Group Operations
The app allows you to apply rotations and reflections to the square by clicking on the buttons in the left-side navigation. You can choose from the 4 rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) and 4 reflections (across the horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal axes).

2. Interactive Visualizations
As you click on the buttons for rotations or flips, the square will change to show the resulting symmetry operation. This helps visualize how each element of the D4 group affects the square.

## How to Use

Apply Rotations: Click on the buttons under the Rotations section in the left-side navigation to rotate the square by 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.

Apply Reflections: Click on the buttons under the Reflections section to flip the square across the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal axes.

Explore Symmetries: Observe how each operation corresponds to an element of the D4 group and how the square's symmetries work.

## Conclusion

This app offers an interactive tool for exploring the Dihedral Group D4 and the symmetries of a square. By applying rotations and reflections, users can see how the square behaves under the different elements of the group. It’s an excellent tool for visualizing group theory concepts and understanding the symmetry operations of polygons.
