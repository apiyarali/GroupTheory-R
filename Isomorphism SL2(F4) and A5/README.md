## Introduction

In this project, we explore the [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_isomorphism) between two mathematical groups: SL<sub>2</sub>(F<sub>4</sub>) and A<sub>5</sub>. At first glance, these two groups might seem completely different, but they actually have the same structure! Here's a simple explanation of the connection between them.

## What is SL<sub>2</sub>(F<sub>4</sub>)?

[SL<sub>2</sub>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL2(R)) is a group that consists of 2x2 matrices with entries from the field F<sub>4</sub> (a small set of numbers, specifically {0, 1, 2, 3}). The elements of this group follow a special rule: their "determinant" must always be 1. Matrices in SL<sub>2</sub>(F<sub>4</sub>) are combined by multiplying them together.

[F<sub>4</sub>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F4_(mathematics)) is the name of a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group).  
[A<sub>5</sub>](https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Alternating_group:A5) is the alternating group of degree five.
