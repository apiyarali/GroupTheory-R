Link to Published App: https://alipiyarali.shinyapps.io/GroupD6Enhanced/

## Introduction

The Group D6 Enhanced app demonstrates the symmetry group of a regular hexagon, known as the Dihedral Group D6, through the permutations of the numbers 1 through 6. This app provides a powerful visualization tool for understanding group theory concepts, including subgroups, cosets, conjugation, and the generation of subgroups.

## What is Dihedral Group D6?

Dihedral Group D6 represents the symmetries of a regular hexagon. It includes rotations and reflections that map the hexagon onto itself. The group has 12 elements, corresponding to the 6 rotations and 6 reflections of the hexagon.

In this app, the elements of D6 are represented as permutations of the numbers 1 through 6. This allows you to see how each symmetry operation (rotation or reflection) affects the positions of the vertices of the hexagon.

## Features

1. Group Elements
The app allows you to explore the elements of D6 by clicking on buttons representing these elements under the Elements of Group heading.

You can multiply two elements by clicking on them to see the resulting element of the group.

2. Subgroups
The app displays all the subgroups of D6, allowing you to see the smaller groups that are contained within D6.

3. Cosets
You can explore the cosets of subgroups, which are the "shifts" of the subgroup elements within the group.

4. Conjugation
The app demonstrates conjugation, showing how elements of D6 interact with each other when combined in a particular way.

5. Generation of Subgroups
You can also generate subgroups from a single element, allowing you to see which elements are produced by repeated operations on a starting element.

## How to Use

Multiplying Group Elements: Click on the elements listed under the Elements of Group heading to multiply them together.

Subgroups and Cosets: Explore the subgroups, cosets, and conjugation by clicking on the corresponding buttons under their respective headings.

Generate Subgroups: Click on the buttons under the Generation of Subgroups heading to generate new subgroups.

## Conclusion

This app provides an interactive and intuitive way to understand the Dihedral Group D6 and its properties. By visualizing symmetries as permutations, you can easily explore the group's structure, including its elements, subgroups, cosets, conjugation, and subgroup generation. It's a valuable tool for anyone studying group theory or interested in the symmetries of regular polygons.
